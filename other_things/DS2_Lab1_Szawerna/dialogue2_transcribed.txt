DIALOGUE 2
M: Uhm, how do I take care of your dog? What do I need to do during the day?
T:  Walk him and feed him.
M: How many walks does he need?
T: 3 or 4. According to him, a lot more.
M: (chuckle) Okay… that’s a good one. Uhm, how long should they be?
T: He usually have one longer and a few shorter. Around half an hour, hour for the longer one.
M: Which one will it be then? Out of the four ones? ‘Cause I guess they are spread out.
T: Uh, the morning walk is usually longer.
M: Okay, sure. Uh, does he have any favorite places to go to?
T: Anything water.
M: Anything water, okay, sure. Uhm, so I should walk him and feed him, right? Uh, how often do I feed him?
T: Uh, morning and dinner.
M: And how- what and how much?
T: Uh, 2 deciliter of dry food- food, and some, uh, tasty thing to it.
M: What constitutes a tasty thing?
T: Ham, wet food, or, uh, the human dinner.
M: Okay, is there anything in the human dinner that I should watch out for, not to give him?
T: Onion and spice.
M: Okay, so that’s not good for a doggo. Uhm, is there anything else I should keep in mind? Uh, when it comes to taking care of him? (...) 
T: Hmm… You might want to shower him.
M: How do I shower him though?
T: You put him in the shower and you… shower him.
M: With like, uh, shampoo or?
T: You can use shampoo. I would use water.
M: Okay. Uh, sure. When do I need to shower him?
T: When he smells.
M: So, all the time?
T: Yes.
M: (chuckle). Okay, so he’s gonna stay in the shower, can do that. He liked water, right?
T: Not shower.
M: But that’s water!
T: No, it’s shower.
M: No, that is water!
T: That is shower. Shower is not good-
M: Okay.
T: -water is good, shower is not good.
M: That is illogical. Is that because it’s clean water?
T: Maybe. Or it’s involuntary water.
M: Okay, sure, uhm, do I need to play with him or anything like that? Does he have any toys?
T: He does have toys.
M: What toys does he like?
T: Things that squeak.
M: Okay.
T: Or reward candy.
M: Okay. You mean like dog candy?
T: Yes.
M: Uhm, okay, I think that’s all the questions. Or do you have any final tips?
T: Give him water?
M: Is that your final tip?
T: Yes, because I didn’t say that when-
M: Yeah. Uh, okay, I will do that. How often do I need to change it?
T: With food.
M: Okay, so, twice a day, sure, I will take the best care of your dog I can. Which is probably not very good. But, I will do my best.
