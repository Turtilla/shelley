DIALOGUE 2
M: Uhm, how do I take care of your dog? What do I need to do during the day?
S: To take proper care of the dog throughout the day you will need to walk it and feed it. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: How many walks does he need?
S: The dog will need around 3 or 4 walks in a day. (SYNTAX, SERIOUSNESS)
M: Uhm, how long should they be? (removing the chuckle as it is a response to something that is not said by the system)
S: Let’s see how long the walks should be. One of the walks should be between 30 minutes and 1 hour. The rest can be shorter than that. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: Which one will it be then? Out of the four ones? ‘Cause I guess they are spread out.
S: Right, it is usually the morning walk that is the longest. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: Okay, sure. Uh, does he have any favorite places to go to?
S: Let’s see what the dog’s favorite walks are. The best places are ones with access to bodies of water. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: Anything water, okay, sure. Uhm, so I should walk him and feed him, right? Uh, how often do I feed him?
S: Back on the topic of food. The dog should be fed in the morning and at dinner-time. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: And how- what and how much?
S: You want to know how much food to give to the dog. It should be 2 deciliters of dry dog food and a bit of something tasty as an extra. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: What constitutes a tasty thing?
S: Right, that would be something like ham, wet dog food, or something from your dinner. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: Okay, is there anything in the human dinner that I should watch out for, not to give him?
S: Let’s see what human foods are not suitable for dogs. You should avoid giving the dog onions or spicy food. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: Okay, so that’s not good for a doggo. Uhm, is there anything else I should keep in mind? Uh, when it comes to taking care of him? (...) 
S: Okay, you want to know what other actions may be necessary when taking care of the dog. You may want to shower it. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: How do I shower him though?
S: In order to shower the dog you should put him in the shower enclosure. (TURNTAKING 2)
M: With like, uh, shampoo or?
S: When showering the dog you can use shampoo or just water. (SYNTAX)
M: Okay. Uh, sure. When do I need to shower him?
S: Right, the dog should be showered when it is smelly. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: So, all the time?
S: You should not shower the dog all the time. The dog should only be showered when its smell is unpleasant and noticeable. (SYNTAX, REFORMULATION, SERIOUSNESS)
(The following few lines were removed both from the user and the system as they were not following the principle of seriousness)
M: Okay, sure, uhm, do I need to play with him or anything like that? Does he have any toys?
S: You want to know if you should play with the dog. You can play with the dog using his toys. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: What toys does he like?
S: The dog’s favorite toys include ones that squeak- (SYNTAX, FEEDBACK 2)
M: Okay.
S: Or reward candy.
M: Okay. You mean like dog candy?
S: Right, human candy is not suitable for dogs. You should only feed dog candy to the dog. (CONFIRMATION, SYNTAX)
M: Uhm, okay, I think that’s all the questions. Or do you have any final tips?
S: Let’s see what steps we have left. You should make sure that the dog has access to fresh water. (SYNTAX)
M: Is that your final tip?
S: This is the final step. (RELEVANCE)
M: Yeah. Uh, okay, I will do that. How often do I need to change it?
S: Fresh water should be given with every meal. (SYNTAX)
M: Okay, so, twice a day, sure, I will take the best care of your dog I can. Which is probably not very good. But, I will do my best.
