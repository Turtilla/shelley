U> Okay done.
S> Next gently place the tortoise in the water and pour some of the water over its shell. Leave the tortoise for a few minutes, but keep an eye out on it.
U> How?
S> Always use both of your hands to carry the tortoise, and provide support for its tummy. It might not be happy in the water, but the bath is important. Make sure that the tortoise has no problems keeping its head up above the water. It's okay if it drinks some of it. It is also fine to leave it there for a few minutes.
U> Okay, done.
S> Righty-o!
U>
S> In the meantime, make sure that the soil is evenly spread in the terrarium and that the decorations are in their right place. You can also clean the glass using an aquarium cleaning spray.
