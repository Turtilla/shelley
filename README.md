# Dialogue Systems 2 - final project "Shelley"
The final project by Maria Irena Szawerna for the Dialogue Systems 2 course in the Master in Language Technology of the University of Gothenburg.

This dialogue system provides instructions on how to perform daily and weekly tortoise care, and can provide information on what is edible for these creatures using custom "API"-like functions to retrieve information from (The Tortoise Table)[https://www.thetortoisetable.org.uk/].
